and will be removed in future. Use torchrun.
Note that --use-env is set by default in torchrun.
If your script expects `--local-rank` argument to be set, please
change it to read from `os.environ['LOCAL_RANK']` instead. See

/baie/data1/data/expes/amrithya.balaji/scRNAseq/scbert/performer_pytorch/performer_pytorch.py:115: UserWarning: torch.qr is deprecated in favor of torch.linalg.qr and will be removed in a future PyTorch release.
The boolean parameter 'some' has been replaced with a string parameter 'mode'.
Q, R = torch.qr(A, some)
should be replaced with
Q, R = torch.linalg.qr(A, 'reduced' if some else 'complete') (Triggered internally at /pytorch/aten/src/ATen/native/BatchLinearAlgebra.cpp:2487.)
  q, r = torch.qr(unstructured_block.cpu(), some = True)
